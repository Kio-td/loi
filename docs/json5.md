# Why use JSON5?

In practice, JSON5 has been noted to be crummy, but I think it's perfect for someone like me. You see, beginner programmers, and even me, at one point, do not want to remember if we should use quotes or apostrophies. It makes it easier for humans to work on. Of course, when the code-writing is all complete, I may think about both parties just using regular JSON again. Right now, the JSON5 module is set to *Take over* the main json function on both the front-end and backend, so deintergration should be a sinch.

## Documenting
You may have noticed that we even have a json5 folder in the repository, containing the markup. It just makes it easier to comment, and to show others, without the need to worry about syntax errors from a comment.
