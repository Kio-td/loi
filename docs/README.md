# Legend of Ikaros - Backend

This is the websocket for Legend of Ikaros. Well.. This is the documentation for the websocket, for the Legend of Ikaos. You get the point.

## What is Legend of Ikaros?

Legend of Ikaros is an Alternate Reality (or so I'm told) that is based upon a certain AI that wreaks havoc on the game you play, including the Goddess. 'What would've been a mundane game became something far better,' he said. Of course, there is no actual AI, it's just being deliberatly made like that.

## A brief history lesson...

This hasn't been the first time I've tried making my dream a reality. Legend of Ikaros began in 2014, as a simple roleplay that was based on [Sword Art Online](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online) - and was quite sexual in nature. Afterwards, in 2016, I tried making an actual game off of it, using a 'Pure PHP' style. (Boy, did that work out against me.) Soon, I got bored. Nobody was paying attention to the game, and I was burdened down by life. A few years later, I tried the roleplay style again, this time inviting a co-owner to help out. We tinkered with the idea of a Dungeon Master style roleplay, even going as far as to include character and stat cards, with dungeon masters even. With that though, my idea was tainted. The story was completely changed, and for the worse. In a fit of anger, that too, was shut down.

Finally, I decided to try this project one more time. In a few pushes, I was about to retry the 'Pure-PHP' style, when I got two little thoughts.

- "The site is really slow. Please speed it up."
- "The server is working really hard for content, don't you think?"

And thus, I decided to remove the PHP framework, and to change my mind. Of course, I still believe that JSAAS is a sin against nature, but, I've been offloading more and more tasks to the client, and making a websocket server that is trusty and dependable.
